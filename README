Kwalbum Without Albums
======================


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install Kohana 3 from http://kohanaphp.com/
2. Make sure Kohana's database module has been enabled and configured.
3. Move the kwalbum directory to kohana's modules directory.
4. Configure Kohana to use the Kwalbum module.
   In your application/bootstrap.php file add
     'kwalbum' => MODPATH.'kwalbum',
   after
     Kohana::modules(array(
   Also make sure that 
     'database'   => MODPATH.'database',   // Database access
   and
     'image'      => MODPATH.'image',      // Image manipulation
   are uncommented and enabled for those modules.
5. Create a writable directory for items to be uploaded to.  The default
   configured location is application/items
6. Optionally, copy modules/kwalbum/config/kwalbum.php to
   application/config/kwalbum.php and edit.  Note that the reason to copy the
   file to applications/config is to ensure it is not overwritten when the
   Kwalbum module is updated.
7. Open Kwalbum in your web browser and go to the install page.
   If Kwalbum is at http://localhost/kwalbum/index.php then the install page
   is at http://localhost/kwalbum/index.php/~install
