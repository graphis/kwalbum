Kwalbum Without Albums
======================


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install Kohana from http://kohanaphp.com/
2. Move the kwalbum directory to kohana's modules directory.
3. Configure Kohana to use the Kwalbum module.
   In kohana's application/config/config.php add
    MODPATH.'kwalbum',
   after
    $config['modules'] = array
    
   See http://docs.kohanaphp.com/general/modules#configuring for more details.
4. Create a writable directory for items to be uploaded to.  The default
   configured location is application/items
5. Move css and js directories to a public location
6. Optionally, copy modules/kwalbum/config/kwalbum.php to
   application/config/kwalbum.php and edit.  Note that the reason to copy the
   file to applications/config is to ensure it is not overwritten when the
   Kwalbum module is updated.
